<PRE>You asked about it....

Basically every now and then, there is a special packet containing a timestamp 
called a PCR - a Program Clock Reference. The encoder and the decoder share a 
clock - these timestamps allows the decoder to synchronise its clock to the 
encoder's one.

The PCR is piggybacked onto one of the existing streams (e.g. in a TV program 
it is really common to add it to the video stream - look in the TS packet 
header in ISO 13181-1 - theres a flag saying whether its there or not).

So to tell the time at an arbitrary byte position in the stream, you find out 
the two nearest PCRs on either side, and interpolate between them.

As streams can contain a variable bitrate, you unfortunately can't just find 
the first few PCRs and average it. However the bitrate between any two 
ADJACENT PCRs in the SAME stream is guaranteed to be constant - so the 
interpolation is dead easy.

It starts to get a bit MORE confusing when you have (say) a DVB-T stream. In 
that, there are multiple programs contained in the one stream (e.g. BBC1, 
BBC2, BBC3, etc) - you have multiple video/audio/subtitle streams all 
multiplexed together. 

Each *program* has its own clock. I'm not sure if the PCR is a global value 
across the entire transport stream, or if it is program specific. Something 
we shall find out I suspect though :)

For our puposes, we'll have to scan the whole stream and determine the PCRs 
when the stream is loaded as part of the background process. They aren't 
necessarily regular, and the design of these streams is not really for what 
we're doing - its for TV broadcast, so we need to do extra processing to get 
the info we need.
