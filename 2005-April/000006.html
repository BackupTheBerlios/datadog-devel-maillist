All seems sensible.

</I>
This may be a silly question. But would I be right in assuming that
there's a convention that only start-of-packet bytes are used in time
interpolation, or something along those lines? If a packet contains,
for example, some MPEG video data I assume you'd want to consider all
that data as belonging to the same point on the timeline.

&gt;<i> As streams can contain a variable bitrate, you unfortunately can't just find
</I>&gt;<i> the first few PCRs and average it. However the bitrate between any two
</I>&gt;<i> ADJACENT PCRs in the SAME stream is guaranteed to be constant - so the
</I>&gt;<i> interpolation is dead easy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It starts to get a bit MORE confusing when you have (say) a DVB-T stream. In

</I>&gt;<i> BBC2, BBC3, etc) - you have multiple video/audio/subtitle streams all
</I>&gt;<i> multiplexed together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each *program* has its own clock. I'm not sure if the PCR is a global value
</I>&gt;<i> across the entire transport stream, or if it is program specific. Something
</I>&gt;<i> we shall find out I suspect though :)
</I>
The way I'd like to think of it is that certain streams have clocks.
Stream A's clock is driven by packets in A, or by packets from a
descendant stream B multiplexed within A. Some other descendant stream
C can inherit the clock from A. This is neat because time information
flows up and down the containment hierarchy in a fairly simple way.

But the clock-per-programme thing you mentioned suggests the
possibility that you can have multiple clocks attached to a stream A,
each connected to a subset of A's descendants. This seems a lot less
neat so I hope it can be described as in the previous paragraph. It
might be possible to introduce a concept of virtual streams to group
together sibling streams which share a clock.
 
&gt;<i> For our puposes, we'll have to scan the whole stream and determine the PCRs
</I>&gt;<i> when the stream is loaded as part of the background process. They aren't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily regular, and the design of these streams is not really for what
</I>&gt;<i> we're doing - its for TV broadcast, so we need to do extra processing to get
</I>&gt;<i> the info we need.
</I>
So given my understanding the algorithm is something like this. Assume
for the time being that all packets in all streams have already been
defined and loaded. You now make a linear pass through them. When you
encounter a PCR you propagate the timestamp up to the stream which
owns the clock, associated with the appropriate byte address. Now you
can make a second pass in which you fill times for all packets by
climbing up to the clock-owning stream and interpolating from byte
address to timestamp.
