<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; So to tell the time at an arbitrary byte position in the stream, you find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out the two nearest PCRs on either side, and interpolate between them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This may be a silly question. But would I be right in assuming that
</I>&gt;<i> there's a convention that only start-of-packet bytes are used in time
</I>&gt;<i> interpolation, or something along those lines? If a packet contains,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, some MPEG video data I assume you'd want to consider all
</I>&gt;<i> that data as belonging to the same point on the timeline.
</I>
The standard defines explictly where the time is measured from somewhere - I 
can't remember the details.

&gt;<i> &gt; As streams can contain a variable bitrate, you unfortunately can't just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find the first few PCRs and average it. However the bitrate between any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; two ADJACENT PCRs in the SAME stream is guaranteed to be constant - so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the interpolation is dead easy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It starts to get a bit MORE confusing when you have (say) a DVB-T stream.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In that, there are multiple programs contained in the one stream (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BBC1, BBC2, BBC3, etc) - you have multiple video/audio/subtitle streams
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all multiplexed together.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each *program* has its own clock. I'm not sure if the PCR is a global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; value across the entire transport stream, or if it is program specific.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Something we shall find out I suspect though :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way I'd like to think of it is that certain streams have clocks.
</I>&gt;<i> Stream A's clock is driven by packets in A, or by packets from a
</I>&gt;<i> descendant stream B multiplexed within A. Some other descendant stream
</I>&gt;<i> C can inherit the clock from A. This is neat because time information
</I>&gt;<i> flows up and down the containment hierarchy in a fairly simple way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the clock-per-programme thing you mentioned suggests the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that you can have multiple clocks attached to a stream A,
</I>&gt;<i> each connected to a subset of A's descendants. This seems a lot less
</I>&gt;<i> neat so I hope it can be described as in the previous paragraph. It
</I>&gt;<i> might be possible to introduce a concept of virtual streams to group
</I>&gt;<i> together sibling streams which share a clock.
</I>
yeah - virtual streams best expresses it. For DVB, you have loads of single 
streams (A+V+subs+control) all packed together into the one transport stream. 
The &quot;virtual&quot; streams are defined by the Program Map Tables - they say which 
single streams belong to which virtual streams (or TV programmes as they will 
be known to the end user).

&gt;<i> &gt; For our puposes, we'll have to scan the whole stream and determine the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PCRs when the stream is loaded as part of the background process. They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aren't necessarily regular, and the design of these streams is not really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for what we're doing - its for TV broadcast, so we need to do extra
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processing to get the info we need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So given my understanding the algorithm is something like this. Assume
</I>&gt;<i> for the time being that all packets in all streams have already been
</I>&gt;<i> defined and loaded. You now make a linear pass through them. When you
</I>&gt;<i> encounter a PCR you propagate the timestamp up to the stream which
</I>&gt;<i> owns the clock, associated with the appropriate byte address. Now you
</I>&gt;<i> can make a second pass in which you fill times for all packets by
</I>&gt;<i> climbing up to the clock-owning stream and interpolating from byte
</I>&gt;<i> address to timestamp.
</I>
Yeah I think so. I think its something we'll have to check empirically as well 
though.
